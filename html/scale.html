        <h2>USING THE PAIN SCALE</h2>
        <p>If you want your pain to be taken seriously,
         It is important that you take the pain scale seriously.</p><br>

        <p>Because pain is subjective, it is difficult to explain what you’re feeling to another person—even your own doctor. To effectively use the pain scale, familiarize yourself with the levels before your procedure, identifying what key levels are indicative to your pain level. Following a surgery or procedure, typically we tell patients to continue to take medications that allow them to maintain a level of “5 or below.”<br>

        0 – Pain Free<br>

       <h3>Mild Pain – Nagging, annoying, but doesn’t really interfere with daily living activities.</h3><br>

        1 – Pain is very mild, barely noticeable. Most of the time you don’t think about it.<br>

        2 – Minor pain. Annoying and may have occasional stronger twinges.<br>

        3 – Pain is noticeable and distracting, however, you can get used to it and adapt. <br>

       <h3>Moderate Pain – Interferes significantly with daily living activities.</h3><br>

        4 – Moderate pain. If you are deeply involved in an activity, it can be ignored for a period of time, but is still distracting.<br>

        5 – Moderately strong pain. It can’t be ignored for more than a few minutes, but with effort you still can manage to work or participate in some social activities.<br>

        6 – Moderately strong pain that interferes with normal daily activities. Difficulty concentrating.<br>

        <h3>Severe Pain – Disabling; unable to perform daily living activities.</h3><br>

        7 – Severe pain that dominates your senses and significantly limits your ability to perform normal daily activities or maintain social relationships. Interferes with sleep.<br>

        8 – Intense pain. Physical activity is severely limited. Conversing requires great effort.<br>

        9 – Excruciating pain. Unable to converse. Crying out and/or moaning uncontrollably. <br>

        10 – Unspeakable pain. Bedridden and possibly delirious. Very few people will ever experience this level of pain.<br>
